## Additional Comments

* This is a new release.

* There are no additional references describing the methods in this package.

* I have created documentation Rd files for many non-exported functions and included examples for these unexported functions. This is a collaborative project, and the documentation is incredibly helpful to on-board new collaborators and help them understand the internal workings of the package. I've read through the R Packages manual and I do not believe there is a specific rule against this, but have heard reports of comments requesting that they are removed. If I can keep the documentation as it is, I would be much appreciative. Thank you!

* Thank you for your time!
