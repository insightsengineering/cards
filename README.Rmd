The [CDISC Analysis Results Standard](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/analysis-results-standards) aims to facilitate automation, reproducibility, reusability, and traceability of analysis results data (ARD).
The {cards} package creates these **C**DISC **A**nalysis **R**esult **D**ata **S**ets.

Use cases:

1. Quality Control (QC) of existing tables and figures.

1. Pre-calculate statistics to be summarized in tables and figures.

1. Medical writers may easily access statistics and place in reports without copying and pasting from reports.

1. Provides a consistent format for results and lends results to be combined across studies for re-use and re-analysis.

## Installation

Install cards from CRAN with:

```r
install.packages("cards")
```

You can install the development version of cards from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("insightsengineering/cards")
```

## Extensions

[![cardx website](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/insightsengineering/cardx/main/man/figures/logo.png){style="float: right" width="120"}](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cardx/)

The {cards} package exports three types of functions:

1.  Functions to create basic ARD objects.

2.  Utilities to create new ARD objects.

3.  Functions to work with existing ARD objects.

The [{cardx}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cardx/) R package is an extension to {cards} that uses the utilities from {cards} and exports functions for creating additional ARD objectsâ€“--including functions to summarize t-tests, Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests, regression models, and more.

## Example

ARD Examples

```{r example}
library(cards)

ard_continuous(ADSL, by = "ARM", variables = c("AGE", "BMIBL"))

ard_categorical(ADSL, by = "ARM", variables = c("AGEGR1", "SEX"))
```
