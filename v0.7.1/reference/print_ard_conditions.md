Function parses the errors and warnings observed while calculating the
statistics requested in the ARD and prints them to the console as
messages.

print_ard_conditions(x, condition_type = c("inform", "identity"))
```

## Arguments

- x:

  (`data.frame`)  
  an ARD data frame of class 'card'

- condition_type:

  (`string`)  
  indicates how warnings and errors are returned. Default is `"inform"`
  where all are returned as messages. When `"identity"`, errors are
  returned as errors and warnings as warnings.

if not.

# passing a character variable for numeric summary
ard_summary(ADSL, variables = AGEGR1) |>
  print_ard_conditions()
#> The following warnings were returned during `print_ard_conditions()`:
