Details section below.}

hierarchy variable from \code{x} to perform filtering on. If \code{NULL}, the last hierarchy variable
from \code{x} (\code{dplyr::last(attributes(x)$args$variables)}) will be used.}

Logical argument indicating whether to retain summary rows corresponding to hierarchy
sections that have had all rows filtered out. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

This function is used to filter stacked hierarchical ARDs.

For the purposes of this function, we define a "variable group" as a combination of ARD rows
grouped by the combination of all their variable levels, but excluding any \code{by} variables.
}
\details{
The \code{filter} argument can be used to filter out variable groups of a hierarchical
ARD which do not meet the requirements provided as an expression.
Variable groups can be filtered on the values of any of the possible
statistics (\code{n}, \code{p}, and \code{N}) provided they are included at least once
in the ARD, as well as the values of any \code{by} variables.

Additionally, filters can be applied on individual levels of the \code{by} variable via the
\code{n_XX}, \code{N_XX}, and \code{p_XX} statistics, where each \code{XX} represents the index of the \code{by}
variable level to select the statistic from. For example, \code{filter = n_1 > 5} will check
whether \code{n} values for the first level of \code{by} are greater than 5 in each row group.

Overall statistics for each row group can be used in filters via the \code{n_overall}, \code{N_overall},
and \code{p_overall} statistics. If the ARD is created with parameter \code{overall=TRUE}, then these
overall statistics will be extracted directly from the ARD, otherwise the statistics will be
derived where possible. If \code{overall=FALSE}, then \code{n_overall} can only be derived if the \code{n}
statistic is present in the ARD for the filter variable, \code{N_overall} if the \code{N} statistic is
present for the filter variable, and \code{p_overall} if both the \code{n} and \code{N} statistics are
present for the filter variable.

To illustrate how the function works, consider the typical example below
where the AE summaries are provided by treatment group.

\if{html}{\out{<div class="sourceCode r">}}\preformatted{ADAE |>
  dplyr::filter(AESOC == "GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS",
                AEDECOD \%in\% c("VOMITING", "DIARRHOEA")) |>
  ard_stack_hierarchical(
    variables = c(AESOC, AEDECOD),
    by = TRTA,
    denominator = ADSL,
    id = USUBJID
  )
}\if{html}{\out{</div>}}\tabular{lrrr}{
   \strong{SOC} / AE \tab Placebo \tab Xanomeline High Dose \tab Xanomeline Low Dose \cr
   \strong{GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS} \tab 11 (13\%) \tab 10 (12\%) \tab 8 (9.5\%) \cr
   DIARRHOEA \tab 9 (10\%) \tab 4 (4.8\%) \tab 5 (6.0\%) \cr
   VOMITING \tab 3 (3.5\%) \tab 7 (8.3\%) \tab 3 (3.6\%) \cr
}


Filters are applied to the summary statistics of the innermost variable in the hierarchy---\code{AEDECOD}
in this case.
If any of the summary statistics meet the filter requirement for any of the treatment groups,
the entire row is retained.
For example, if \code{filter = n >= 9} were passed, the criteria would be met for DIARRHOEA
as the Placebo group observed 9 AEs and as a result the summary statistics for the other
treatment groups would be retained as well.
Conversely, no treatment groups' summary statistics satisfy the filter requirement
for VOMITING so all rows associated with this AE would be removed.

In addition to filtering on individual statistic values, filters can be applied
across the treatment groups (i.e. across all \code{by} variable values) by using
aggregate functions such as \code{sum()} and \code{mean()}. For simplicity, it is suggested to use
the \code{XX_overall} statistics in place of \code{sum(XX)} in equivalent scenarios. For example,
\code{n_overall} is equivalent to \code{sum(n)}.
A value of \code{filter = sum(n) >= 18} (or \code{filter = n_overall >= 18}) retains AEs where the sum of
the number of AEs across the treatment groups is greater than or equal to 18.

If \code{ard_stack_hierarchical(overall=TRUE)} was run, the overall column is \strong{not} considered in
any filtering except for \code{XX_overall} statistics, if specified.

If \code{ard_stack_hierarchical(over_variables=TRUE)} was run, any overall statistics are kept regardless
of filtering.

Some examples of possible filters:
\itemize{
\item \code{filter = n > 5}: keep AEs where one of the treatment groups observed more than 5 AEs
\item \code{filter = n == 2 & p < 0.05}: keep AEs where one of the treatment groups observed exactly 2
AEs \emph{and} one of the treatment groups observed a proportion less than 5\%
\item \code{filter = n_overall >= 4}: keep AEs where there were 4 or more AEs observed across the treatment groups
\item \code{filter = mean(n) > 4 | n > 3}: keep AEs where the mean number of AEs is 4 or more across the
treatment groups \emph{or} one of the treatment groups observed more than 3 AEs
\item \code{filter = n_2 > 2}: keep AEs where the \code{"Xanomeline High Dose"} treatment group (second \code{by} variable
level) observed more than 2 AEs
