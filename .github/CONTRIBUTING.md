# Contributing to cards

This outlines how to propose a change to {cards}.

## Fixing typos

You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly using the GitHub web interface, as long as the changes are made in the _source_ file. 
This generally means you'll need to edit [roxygen2 comments](https://roxygen2.r-lib.org/articles/roxygen2.html) in an `.R`, not a `.Rd` file. 
You can find the `.R` file that generates the `.Rd` by reading the comment in the first line.

## Bigger changes

If you want to make a bigger change, it's a good idea to first file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it’s needed. 
If you’ve found a bug, please file an issue that illustrates the bug with a minimal 
[reprex](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#reprex) (this will also help you write a unit test, if needed).
See guide on [how to create a great issue](https://code-review.tidyverse.org/issues/) for more advice.

### Pull request process

*   Fork the package and clone onto your computer. 

*   Install all development dependencies with `devtools::install_dev_deps()`, and then make sure the package passes R CMD check by running `devtools::check()`. 
    If R CMD check doesn't pass cleanly, it's a good idea to ask for help before continuing. 
*   Create a Git branch for your pull request (PR). 

*   Make your changes, commit to git, and then create a PR.
    The title of your PR should briefly describe the change.
    The body of your PR should contain `Closes #issue-number`.

*  For user-facing changes, add a bullet to the top of `NEWS.md` (i.e. just below the first header). Follow the style described in <https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html>.

* Note for your first contribution you will need to accept the [Individual Contributor License Agreement](https://github.com/insightsengineering/.github/blob/main/CLA.md). To do so please leave a comment stating "I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA" on the Pull Request.

### Code Style

*   New code should follow the tidyverse [style guide](https://style.tidyverse.org). 
    You can use the [styler](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=styler) package to apply these styles, but please don't restyle code that has nothing to do with your PR.  
    
    * To apply the appropriate style with styler please use `styler:::style_active_pkg()`

*  We use [roxygen2](https://cran.r-project.org/package=roxygen2), with [Markdown syntax](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/roxygen2/vignettes/rd-formatting.html), for documentation.  

*  We use [testthat](https://cran.r-project.org/package=testthat) for unit tests. 
   Contributions with test cases included are easier to accept.  
   
*  All helper/non-exported function are named with a period prefix, e.g. `.helper_function()`.

*  All helper/non-exported functions are documented with roxygen2 as indicated above. 
   Include `#' @keywords internal` to mark the function as internal.
   Any helper functions that appear in examples, will need to use the `cards:::` 
   prefix, e.g. `#' @example cards:::.helper_function()`

### Error Handling

We use the {cli} package to signal errors, warnings, and messages to users.
For each call to `cli::cli_abort()`, the `call` argument must be used to correctly message to users the calling function.
Any general function that can be re-used to check, for example, user-passed argument values, shall be placed in `R\import-standalone-checks.R`.
The checks in this file are re-used among multiple projects.
If you do need to modify this file, please review the section below about standalone scripts.

### Package Dependencies

Generally, no additional package dependencies may be added.
If the code you add would be more readable using, for example, using a {tidyverse} function, 
consider adding a shim for the function in one of the standalone scripts.
See the section below about standalone scripts for details.

### Standalone Scripts

The package utilizes a few standalone scripts that are used across a few projects.
Some of these scripts make available shims for common tidyverse functions, so you can use the function without depending on the package.
The `"checks"` script is a series of functions to check the argument values supplied by users, and provides informative error messages when the values are not valid.
Do not make changes to these files directly: rather, update these files in their source location.

- `import-standalone-purrr.R`: https://github.com/r-lib/rlang/blob/main/R/standalone-purrr.R
- `import-standalone-forcats.R` https://github.com/insightsengineering/standalone/blob/main/R/standalone-forcats.R
- `import-standalone-stringr.R` https://github.com/insightsengineering/standalone/blob/main/R/standalone-stringr.R
- `import-standalone-checks.R` https://github.com/insightsengineering/standalone/blob/main/R/standalone-checks.R

After the update has been made, you can copy the file into the repo with 

```r
usethis::use_standalone("r-lib/rlang", file = "purrr")
usethis::use_standalone("insightsengineering/standalone", file = "forcats")
usethis::use_standalone("insightsengineering/standalone", file = "stringr")
usethis::use_standalone("insightsengineering/standalone", file = "checks")
```

## Scope

The {cards} package exports basic functions for creating ARDs (such as, univariate continuous summaries, tabulations, etc.), and utilities for creating/working with ARDs.
All new functions to create ARDs will live in the [{cardx}](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cardx) package.

## Deprecation Cycle

In the {cards} package we soft deprecate for 6 months, then warn for an additional 6 months, then defunct for 6 more months for a total of 18 months.
