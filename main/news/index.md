  ([\#509](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/509))

## cards 0.7.0

CRAN release: 2025-08-27

### New Features and Functions

- Updated
  [`sort_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/sort_ard_hierarchical.md)
  to allow for different sorting methods at each hierarchy variable
  level.
  ([\#487](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/487))

- Updated
  [`sort_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/sort_ard_hierarchical.md)
  and
  [`filter_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/filter_ard_hierarchical.md)
  to always keep attribute and total N rows at the bottom of the ARD.

- Added argument `var` to
  [`filter_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/filter_ard_hierarchical.md)
  to allow filtering by any hierarchy variable.
  ([\#467](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/467))

- Added flexibility to filter by `by` variable level-specific values
  when using
  [`filter_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/filter_ard_hierarchical.md)
  to allow for filtering of hierarchical ARDs by difference in two
  rates.
  ([\#438](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/438))

- The
  [`ard_strata()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_strata.md)
  function has been updated to include the strata columns in the nested
  data frames.
  ([\#461](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/461))

- Similar to
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md),
  [`ard_stack()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack.md)
  contains an `args` attribute to retain information about input
  arguments.

- Added an article illustrating how to summarize long data structures.
  ([\#356](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/356))

- Added `ard_stack(.by_stat)` and `ard_stack_hierarchical(by_stat)`
  arguments that, when `TRUE` (the default), includes a univariate ARD
  tabulation of the `by` variable in the returned ARD.
  ([\#335](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/335))

- [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  passes down the `args` attribute of the input `card` object when
  present.
  ([\#484](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/484),
  [@dragosmg](https://github.com/dragosmg))

- [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  fills overall or group statistics with `"Overall <column_name>"` or
  `"Any <column_name>"`.
  ([\#337](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/337),
  [@dragosmg](https://github.com/dragosmg))

- [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  messages if `"Overall <column_names>"` is accidentally present in the
  data and creates a unique label.
  ([\#465](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/465),
  [@dragosmg](https://github.com/dragosmg))

- Add `ADLB` data set.
  ([\#450](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/450))

### Lifecycle Changes

- The following functions have been renamed. The old functions still
  work in the package, and will be soft deprecated in the next release.
  ([\#470](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/470))
  - [`ard_continuous()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
    to
    [`ard_summary()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_summary.md)
  - [`ard_complex()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
    to
    [`ard_mvsummary()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_mvsummary.md)
  - [`ard_categorical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
    to
    [`ard_tabulate()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_tabulate.md)
  - [`ard_dichotomous()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
    to
    [`ard_tabulate_value()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_tabulate_value.md)
- `shuffle` and `.shuffle` arguments (for
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md)
  and
  [`ard_stack()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack.md))
  are deprecated and users encouraged to call
  [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  directly.
  ([\#475](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/475),
  [@dragosmg](https://github.com/dragosmg))

## cards 0.6.1

CRAN release: 2025-07-03

### New Features and Functions

- Added new function
  [`ard_identity()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_identity.md)
  for saving pre-calculated statistics in an ARD format.
  ([\#379](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/379))

### Lifecycle Changes

- Updating any `fmt_fn` references to `fmt_fun` for consistency.

  - Any function with an argument `cards::foo(fmt_fn)` has been updated
    to `cards::foo(fmt_fun)`. The old syntax will continue to function,
    but with a deprecation warning to users.

  - The following function names have been updated:
    [`alias_as_fmt_fun()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/alias_as_fmt_fun.md),
    [`apply_fmt_fun()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/apply_fmt_fun.md),
    and
    [`update_ard_fmt_fun()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/update_ard.md).
    The former function names are still exported from the package, and
    users will see a deprecation note when they are used.

  - Importantly, the ARD column named `"fmt_fn"` has been updated to
    `"fmt_fun"`. This change cannot be formally deprecated. For users
    who were accessing the ARD object directly to modify this column
    instead of using functions like
    [`update_ard_fmt_fun()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/update_ard.md),
    this will be a breaking change.

### Bug Fixes

- Fix bug in
  [`sort_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/sort_ard_hierarchical.md)
  when hierarchical ARD has `overall=TRUE`.
  ([\#431](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/431))

- Fix bug in
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md)
  when `id` values are present in multiple levels of the `by` variables.
  ([\#442](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/442))

- Fix bug in
  [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  where error is thrown if input contains hierarchical results.
  ([\#447](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/447))

## cards 0.6.0

CRAN release: 2025-04-11

### New Features and Functions

- Added functions
  [`sort_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/sort_ard_hierarchical.md)
  and
  [`filter_ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/filter_ard_hierarchical.md)
  to sort & filter ARDs created using
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md)
  and
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical_count()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md).
  ([\#301](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/301))

- Updated
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md)
  and
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical_count()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md)
  to automatically sort results alphanumerically.
  ([\#423](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/423))

- Added new function
  [`unlist_ard_columns()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/unlist_ard_columns.md).
  ([\#391](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/391))

- Updated function
  [`rename_ard_columns()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/rename_ard_columns.md).
  ([\#380](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/380))

  - The function no longer coerces values to character.

  - The `fill` argument has been added to specify a value to fill in the
    new column when there are no levels associated with the variables
    (e.g. continuous summaries).

  - The `unlist` argument has been deprecated in favor of using the new
    [`unlist_ard_columns()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/unlist_ard_columns.md)
    function.

  - The function no longer accepts generic data frames: inputs must be a
    data frame of class `card`.

- Added function
  [`ard_formals()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_formals.md)
  to assist in adding a function’s formals, that is, the arguments with
  their default values, along with user-passed arguments into an ARD
  structure.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed sorting order of logical variables in
  [`nest_for_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/nest_for_ard.md).
  ([\#411](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/411))

### Lifecycle Changes

- The
  [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  function no longer outputs a `'label'` column, and instead retains the
  original `'variable'` level from the cards object. It also no longer
  trims rows with non-numeric stats values.
  ([\#416](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/416))

## cards 0.5.1

CRAN release: 2025-03-01

- Small update to account for a change in R-devel.

## cards 0.5.0

CRAN release: 2025-02-17

### New Features and Functions

- Added functions
  [`rename_ard_groups_shift()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/rename_ard_groups.md)
  and
  [`rename_ard_groups_reverse()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/rename_ard_groups.md)
  for renaming the grouping variables in the ARD.
  ([\#344](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/344))

- Added an option to specify the default rounding in the package:
  `cards.round_type`. See
  [`?cards.options`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/cards.options.md)
  for details.
  ([\#384](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/384))

- Added the `print_ard_conditions(condition_type)` argument, which
  allows users to select to return conditions as messages (the default),
  or have warnings returned as warnings and errors as errors.
  ([\#386](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/386))

- Added the `all_ard_group_n(types)` argument to allow separate
  selection of `groupX` and `groupX_level` columns.

- Added the `tidy_ard_column_order(group_order)` argument that allows
  users to specify whether the grouping variables are listed in
  ascending order (the default) or descending order. The output of
  [`ard_strata()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_strata.md)
  now calls `tidy_ard_column_order(group_order="descending")`.

### Other Updates

- A new article has been added detailing how to create new ARD
  functions.

- Results are now sorted in a consistent manner, by descending groups
  and strata.
  ([\#342](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/342),
  [\#326](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/326))

### Lifecycle Updates

- Function `label_cards()` has been renamed to
  [`label_round()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/label_round.md),
  which more clearly communicates that is returns a rounding function.

## cards 0.4.0

CRAN release: 2024-11-27

### New Features and Functions

- Added functions
  [`as_cards_fn()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/as_cards_fn.md),
  [`is_cards_fn()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/as_cards_fn.md),
  and
  [`get_cards_fn_stat_names()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/as_cards_fn.md).
  These functions assist is creating functions with attributes
  enumerating the expected results.

- Updated
  [`ard_continuous()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  and
  [`ard_complex()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  to return full ARDs when functions passed are created with
  [`as_cards_fn()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/as_cards_fn.md):
  instead of a single row output, we get a long ARD with rows for each
  of the expected statistic names.
  ([\#316](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/316))

- Added function
  [`ard_pairwise()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_pairwise.md)
  to ease the calculations of pairwise analyses.
  ([\#359](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/359))

### Other Updates

- Improved messaging in
  [`print_ard_conditions()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/print_ard_conditions.md)
  when the calling function is namespaced.
  ([\#348](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/348))

- Updated print method for `'card'` objects so extraneous columns are
  never printed by default.

### Lifecycle Changes

- No longer exporting functions `check_pkg_installed()`,
  `is_pkg_installed()`, `get_min_version_required()`,
  `get_pkg_dependencies()`. These functions are now internal-only.
  ([\#330](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/330))

### Bug Fixes

- The
  [`tidy_ard_column_order()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/tidy_ard_order.md)
  now correctly orders grouping columns when there are 10+ groups. This
  also corrects an issue in the hierarchical functions where the
  ordering of the variables matters.
  ([\#352](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/352))

## cards 0.3.0

CRAN release: 2024-10-03

### New Features & Updates

- Added functions
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md)
  and
  [`ard_stack_hierarchical_count()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack_hierarchical.md)
  that ease the creation of ARDs for multiple nested or hierarchical
  structures.
  ([\#314](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/314))

- Added functions
  [`update_ard_fmt_fn()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  and
  [`update_ard_stat_label()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/update_ard.md)
  to update an ARD’s formatting function and statistic label,
  respectively.
  ([\#253](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/253))

- Added `rename_ard_columns(unlist)` argument, which unlists specified
  columns in the ARD data frame.
  ([\#313](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/313))

- Added
  [`ard_strata()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_strata.md)
  function to ease the task of calculating ARDs stratified by one or
  more other categorical variables.
  ([\#273](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/273))

- Added functions
  [`mock_continuous()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/mock.md),
  [`mock_categorical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/mock.md),
  [`mock_dichotomous()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/mock.md),
  [`mock_missing()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/mock.md),
  [`mock_attributes()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/mock.md)
  to build ARDs in the absence of a data frame. Where applicable, the
  formatting functions are set to return `'xx'` or `'xx.x'` to aid in
  the construction of mock tables or table shells.
  ([\#256](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/256))

- Added functions for printing results from
  [`eval_capture_conditions()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/eval_capture_conditions.md).
  Captured conditions can be printed as either errors or messages with
  [`captured_condition_as_error()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/eval_capture_conditions.md)
  and
  [`captured_condition_as_message()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/eval_capture_conditions.md),
  respectively.
  ([\#282](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/282))

### Other Updates

- The
  [`ard_hierarchical_count()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_hierarchical.md)
  function has been updated to match the behavior of
  [`ard_hierarchical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_hierarchical.md)
  and results are now only returned for the last column listed in the
  `variables` arguments, rather than recursively counting all variables.

- Add columns `'fmt_fn'`, `'warning'`, and `'errors'` to
  [`ard_attributes()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_attributes.md)
  output.
  ([\#327](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/327))

- Add checks for factors with no levels, or any levels that are `NA`
  into `ard_*` functions
  ([\#255](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/255))

- Any rows with `NA` or `NaN` values in the `.by` columns specified in
  [`ard_stack()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack.md)
  are now removed from all calculations.
  ([\#320](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/320))

## cards 0.2.2

CRAN release: 2024-09-02

### New Features & Updates

- Converted
  [`ard_total_n()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_total_n.md)
  to an S3 generic and added method
  [`ard_total_n.data.frame()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_total_n.md).

- Added the `bind_ard(.quiet)` argument to suppress messaging.
  ([\#299](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/299))

- Improved ability of
  [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  to populate missing group values where possible.
  ([\#306](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/306))

- Added `apply_fmt_fn(replace)` argument. Use `replace=FALSE` to retain
  any previously formatted statistics in the `stat_fmt` column.
  ([\#285](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/285))

- Added `bind_ard(.distinct)` argument, which can remove non-distinct
  rows from the ARD across grouping variables, primary variables,
  context, statistic name and value.
  ([\#286](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/286))

### Bug Fixes

- Fix in
  [`print_ard_conditions()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/print_ard_conditions.md)
  when the variables were factors, which did not render properly in
  [`cli::cli_format()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/cli_format.html).

- Bug fix in
  [`print_ard_conditions()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/print_ard_conditions.md)
  and we can now print condition messages that contain curly brace
  pairs.
  ([\#309](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/309))

## cards 0.2.1

CRAN release: 2024-08-17

- Update in
  [`ard_categorical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  to use [`base::order()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/order.html) instead of
  [`dplyr::arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html),
  so the ordering of variables match the results from
  [`base::table()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/table.html) in some edge
  cases where sorted order was inconsistent.

- Update in
  [`ard_categorical()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  to run [`base::table()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/table.html) output
  checks against coerced character columns. Previously, we relied on R
  to perform checks on the type it decided to check against (e.g. when
  it coerces to a common type). While the initial strategy worked in
  cases of Base R classes, there were some bespoke classes, such as
  times from {hms}, where Base R does not coerce as we expected.

- Adding selectors `all_group_n()` and
  [`all_missing_columns()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/selectors.md).
  ([\#272](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/272),
  [\#274](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/274))

- Added new function
  [`add_calculated_row()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/add_calculated_row.md)
  for adding a new row of calculated statistic(s) that are a function of
  the other statistics in the ARD.
  ([\#275](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/275))

## cards 0.2.0

CRAN release: 2024-07-20

### New Features & Updates

- Converting `ard_*()` functions and other helpers to S3 generics to
  make them extendable.
  ([\#227](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/227))

- Added helper
  [`rename_ard_columns()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/rename_ard_columns.md)
  for renaming/coalescing group/variable columns.
  ([\#213](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/213)).

- Added new function
  [`ard_total_n()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_total_n.md)
  for calculating the total N in a data frame.
  ([\#236](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/236))

- Added the `nest_for_ard(include_data)` argument to either include or
  exclude the subsetted data frames in a list-column in the returned
  tibble.

- Added `check_ard_structure(column_order, method)` arguments to the
  function to check for column ordering and whether result contains a
  `stat_name='method'` row.

- Added the optional `ard_hierarchical(id)` argument. When provided we
  check for duplicates across the column(s) supplied here. If duplicates
  are found, the user is warned that the percentages and denominators
  are not correct.
  ([\#214](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/214))

- Improved messaging in `check_pkg_installed()` that incorporates the
  calling function name in the case of an error.
  ([\#205](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/205))

- Updated `is_pkg_installed()` and `check_pkg_installed()` to allow
  checks for more than package at a time. The
  `get_min_version_required()` function has also been updated to return
  a tibble instead of a list with attributes.
  ([\#201](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/201))

- Styling from the {cli} package are now removed from errors and
  warnings when they are captured with
  [`eval_capture_conditions()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/eval_capture_conditions.md).
  Styling is removed with
  [`cli::ansi_strip()`](https://cli.r-lib.org/reference/ansi_strip.html).
  ([\#129](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/129))

### Bug Fixes

- Bug fix in
  [`ard_stack()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack.md)
  when calls to functions were namespaced.
  ([\#242](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/242))

- The
  [`print_ard_conditions()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/print_ard_conditions.md)
  function has been updated to no longer error out if the ARD object
  does not have `"error"` or `"warning"` columns.
  ([\#240](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/240))

- Bug fix in
  [`shuffle_ard()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/deprecated.md)
  where factors were coerced to integers instead of their labels.
  ([\#232](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/232))

### Lifecycle Changes

- Corrected order that `ard_categorical` (strata) columns would appear
  in the ARD results. Previously, they appeared in the order they
  appeared in the original data, and now they are sorted properly.
  ([\#221](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/221))

- The API for `ard_continuous(statistic)` and `ard_missing(statistic)`
  arguments has been updated. Previously, the RHS of these argument’s
  passed lists would be either
  [`continuous_summary_fns()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/summary_functions.md)
  and `missing_summary_fns()`. Now these arguments accept simple
  character vectors of the statistic names. For example,
  `ard_categorical(statistic = everything() ~ c("n", "p", "N"))` and
  `ard_missing(statistic = everything() ~ c("N_obs", "N_miss", "N_nonmiss", "p_miss", "p_nonmiss"))`.
  ([\#223](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/223))

- Updated
  [`ard_stack()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_stack.md)
  to return `n`, `p`, and `N` for the `by` variable when specified.
  Previously, it only returned `N` which is the same for all levels of
  the by variable.
  ([\#219](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/219))

- Bug fix where `ard_stack(by)` argument was not passed to
  [`ard_missing()`](https://insightsengineering.github.io/cards/reference/ard_missing.md)
  when `ard_stack(.missing=TRUE)`.
  ([\#244](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/244))

- The `ard_stack(by)` argument has been renamed to `".by"` and its
  location moved to after the dots inputs, e.g. `ard_stack(..., .by)`.
  ([\#243](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/243))

- A messaging overhaul to utilize the scripts in
  `https://github.com/ddsjoberg/standalone/blob/main/R/standalone-cli_call_env.R`.
  This allows clear error messaging across functions and packages.
  ([\#42](https://github.com/insightsengineering/cards/issues/42))

  - The `print_ard_conditions(call)`, `check_list_elements(env)`,
    `cards_select(.call)` arguments have been removed.
